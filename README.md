### EDA
Given the nature of natural language processing, the data required a substantial amount of processing and took up the greatest portion of the day. At the outset, we each started working independently on functions to handle abberant values and create a workable input. After some incremental progress, Daron created a DeepNote for everyone to centralize their efforts. The result was a single function that was able to extract the sightings and their respective attributes, i.e. location, time,  eyewitness account, and even shape!
